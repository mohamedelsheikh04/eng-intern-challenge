# Braille Translator: Development Process

This document outlines the process of developing and testing the Braille translator, a Python-based command-line tool that converts text between English and Braille.

## Development Steps

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Created a new Python file named `translator.py`.
   - Added the shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env python3` for Unix-like systems.
   - Imported the `sys` module for handling command-line arguments.

2. **BrailleTranslator Class Design**
   - Defined the `BrailleTranslator` class to encapsulate all translation logic.
   - Created dictionaries for Braille-to-English and English-to-Braille mappings.
   - Defined constants for number prefix and capital letter prefix in Braille.
   - Created a dictionary for number representations in Braille.

3. **Translation Methods**
   - Implemented `translate` method to determine input type and call appropriate translation function.
   - Created `is_braille` static method to detect if input is Braille.
   - Developed `braille_to_english` method for Braille to English translation:
     - Handles capital letters and numbers.
     - Processes input in 6-character chunks.
   - Implemented `english_to_braille` method for English to Braille translation:
     - Handles uppercase letters, numbers, and spaces.

4. **Main Function**
   - Created `main()` function to handle command-line input.
   - Implemented input validation and error handling for insufficient arguments.
   - Instantiated `BrailleTranslator` and called `translate` method with joined input arguments.

5. **Testing**
   - Added test cases directly in the script for quick verification.
   - Created a list of test cases covering various scenarios:
     - English to Braille
     - Braille to English
     - Numbers
     - Mixed case and numbers
   - Implemented a simple loop to run and display results for all test cases.

## Testing Process

1. **Manual Testing**
   - Ran the script with various inputs to verify basic functionality.
   - Tested edge cases like empty input, single characters, and long strings.

2. **Automated Testing**
   - Integrated test cases directly into the script for continuous verification.
   - Test cases cover:
     - Simple English phrases
     - Braille input
     - Numeric input
     - Mixed alphanumeric input with varied capitalization

3. **Iterative Improvements**
   - Identified and fixed issues with number handling and capitalization.
   - Refined the translation logic based on test results.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Handling Numbers**
   - Challenge: Representing numbers in Braille requires a special prefix.
   - Solution: Implemented a number mode triggered by the number prefix in Braille.

2. **Capitalization**
   - Challenge: Braille uses a capital letter prefix for uppercase letters.
   - Solution: Added logic to handle the capital prefix in Braille-to-English translation.

3. **Input Validation**
   - Challenge: Ensuring robust handling of various input types.
   - Solution: Implemented `is_braille` method to automatically detect input type.

## Future Improvements

- Implement more comprehensive error handling for malformed input.
- Add support for punctuation marks.
- Create a separate test suite file for more extensive unit testing.
- Optimize performance for handling larger inputs.

## Conclusion

The development process of this Braille translator focused on creating a robust, functional tool with built-in testing capabilities. The iterative approach allowed for continuous improvement and validation of the translation logic.
